# Overview
In this software my goal was to create a simple calculator that could add, subtract, multiply, divide, find the square, and square root of a number. I accomplished this by using three functions:
One for the basic calculations, one for finding the square of a number, and one for finding the square root of a number. 

The goal I had for writing this software was to learn how to use the language Kotlin. This is the first project that I have made using Kotlin.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA to write my program in. I also had to import math.sqrt in order to get the square root of the given number.

# Future Work

- I have some error handling that still needs to be implemented. 
- I would like to add more functions such as being able to use exponents
